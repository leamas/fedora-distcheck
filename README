dist-check README

Here are two scripts which together will run fedora-review on all packages.
It takes a long, long time but seems to work somehow.

The basic idea is that we need to
- List all packages (done from the webpages).
- Find out the srpm for each package and lump package(s) and srpm together
- Download the packages when it's time for review, in parallel with
  review work.
- Discard all downloaded packages when the review goes well.

The first script is dist-check-setup. It will create a directory for each
source package. In the directory are references to all package built from the
source. This is not big (~100 MB) and can be reused.

Second script is dist-check-run. It will download packages and run
fedora-review on them. It wants a list of directories created by
dist-check-setup on stdin.

The way I use it is to create a subdir under dist-check and run the scripts
there:
    $ cd dist-check
    $ mkdir  work
    $ cd work
    $ ../dist-check-setup # wait for hours
    $ ls | ../dist-check-run |& tee run.log  # wait for days...

You probably want to use "export REVIEW_LOGLEVEL=warning" to decrease the
noise.

Also you might want to disable mock (speeds up). Do so by including
dist-check/bin in PATH in the beginning, so f-r finds "our" mock mock (sic!)
instead of /usr/bin/mock.

If you get signing errors for the rawhide packages you will find the keys
to install in the generic-release package (also in rawhide!)

## Post things:

dist-check-run creates a pkg.results dir for each run with review template
and logfile.

If you want to re-run a directory after patching f-r there is scripts to
download rpms and run f-r (download-dir + run-dir)

Oneliners:

All timing info in a logfile, sorted:
    $ grep ted: pkg.results/fedora-review.log | sort -n -t : -k 3 -r
